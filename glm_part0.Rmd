# Preamble

Statistics is a branch of mathematics.  Therefore it is inevitable that this
tutorial WILL visit numerous mathematical concepts and present mathematical
numenclature.  In an attempt to contain the dread felt by readers who have long
seen off the tortorous high school mathematics lessons,  I will try to introduce
these elements as gently as possible and will attempt to maintain a consistent
use of symbology throughout.  Keep in mind, that although it is possible to fit
linear models without understanding the underlying mathematics, a more solid
grounding will help ensure that models are fit and interpreted correctly.


# Linear models

One of the main goals of fitting a statistical model is to use a sample of
observed data to be able to gain some insights into the presence or nature of
relationships between a response and predictors in a defined population.  This
is achieved by first proposing one or more (deterministic) mathematical
representations of possible relationships and then challenge the representation
with data.

For example, we might propose that an increase in a predictor ($x$) will be
associated with a linear increase in a response ($y$).

```{r mod1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3,fig.width=3, warning=FALSE}
x=1:10
y=2+5*x
ggplot(data=NULL, aes(y=y, x=x)) + geom_line() + theme_classic() +
    theme(axis.text=element_blank(), axis.ticks=element_blank())
```

The general mathematical equation of the linear line is:

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta x_i
$$

where:

- $y_i$ represents a vector (think single variable) of response values
  (the subset $i$ is a way to indicate that there are multiple values), 
- $x_i$ represents the value of the $ith$ observed predictor value.  
- $\beta_0$ represents a single y-intercept (expected value of $y$ when $x$=0),
- $\beta$ represents the __slope__ of the linear line (this is the rate of
  change in $y$ associated with 1 unit change in $x$).

The above expression can be re-written as:
$$
y_i = \beta_0\times 1 + \beta_1\times x_i
$$

which we can visualize in vector/matrix form as:
$$
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\
y_2\\
y_3\\
...\\
y_i
\end{bmatrix}}_{Y} = 
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
1&x_1\\
1&x_2\\
1&x_3\\
...\\
1&x_i
\end{bmatrix}}_{\boldsymbol{X}}
\underbrace{\vphantom{\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\
y_2\\
y_3\\
...\\
y_i
\end{bmatrix}}\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0&\beta
\end{bmatrix}}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}
$$


So given a sample of observed response ($y$) and predictor ($x$) values, we want
to be able to estimate the two unknowns ($\beta_0$ and $\beta$) in the above
mathematical expression.  If we assume that there is no uncertainty in the data,
we can easily calculate the necessary value of $\beta_0$ and $\beta$ using any
two data pairs and solving simultaneous equations.

<details><summary>simultaneous equations solution</summary>
$$
\begin{align}
7 =& \beta_0 + \beta 1, 12 = \beta_0 + \beta 2\\
\beta_0 =& 7 - \beta ~~(\text{isolate }\beta_0\text{ from the first equation})\\
\beta =& 5 ~~(\text{solve for }\beta)\\
\beta_0 =& 2 ~~(\text{substitute }\beta\text{ and solve for }\beta_0)\\
\end{align}
$$
</details>    
    
	
The above model is a deterministic or mathematical model - it suggests complete
confidence in the relationship.  As already indicated, the point of statistical
modelling is to formulate the equation in the presence of a sample of data drawn
from the actual population.   The models themselves are always a low-dimensional representation
of reality.  They cannot hope to capture all the complexity contained in the
system and nor do they want to.  They just want to provide insights into a very
small fraction of this complexity.  

Since a set of observed responses is likely to be the result of a large (if not
infinite) number of interacting processes, the chances that all observed
responses will respond to the predictor in exactly the same way is highly
unlikely.  Therefore, in all data there is noise.
In modelling, we want to see if there is any detectable signal amongst all the noise.

Statistical models include both a deterministic component (a mathematical
expression that relates a response to one or more predictors) as well as a
stochastic component (representing uncertaintly).  For example, the following
figures highlight the distinction between a purely deterministic (mathematical)
model (left hand figure) and a statistical model (right hand figure).

```{r compareModels, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3,fig.width=6, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(234)
x=1:10
y=2+5*x
y1=2+5*x + rnorm(10,0,4) 
g1=ggplot(data=NULL, aes(y=y, x=x)) + geom_line() + theme_classic() +
    annotate(geom='text', y=40, x=2, label=expression(y==2+5*x), parse=TRUE, hjust=0)
g2=ggplot(data=NULL, aes(y=y1, x=x)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm', se=FALSE) + theme_classic() +
    annotate(geom='text', y=40, x=2, label=expression(y==2+5*x+epsilon), parse=TRUE, hjust=0) +
    scale_y_continuous('y')
grid.arrange(g1, g2, nrow=1)
```


The statistical model captures the stochastic component ($\varepsilon$) which
represents the degree to which each observed value differs from what would be
expected in the absence of any noise (uncertainty).  These differences between
observed and expected values are called **residuals**.
$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i
$$

Again, in vector and matrix form, this would be:
$$
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\
y_2\\
y_3\\
...\\
y_i
\end{bmatrix}}_{Y} = 
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
1&x_1\\
1&x_2\\
1&x_3\\
...\\
1&x_i
\end{bmatrix}}_{\boldsymbol{X}}
\underbrace{\vphantom{\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\
y_2\\
y_3\\
...\\
y_i
\end{bmatrix}}\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0&\beta
\end{bmatrix}}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} + 
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_1\\
\varepsilon_2\\
\varepsilon_3\\
...\\
\varepsilon_i
\end{bmatrix}}_{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}
$$

- $Y$ represents a column vector of the observed data
- $\boldsymbol{X}$ represents what is called the _model matrix_.  In this case,
  that is just a single column matrix of 1s.  The ones indicate that there is an
  intercept.  In matrix algebra, matrices are multiplied, so a column of ones
  just ensures that the thing being multiplied does exist.
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ represents a vector of parameters to be estimated.  In
  this case, there is only one.
- $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ represents a column vector or residuals.  

This could all be summarised as:
$$
Y = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
$$

# Example data

This tutorial will blend theoretical discussions with actual calculations and
model fits.  I believe that by bridging the divide between theory and
application, we all gain better understanding.  The applied components of this
tutorial will be motivated by two fabricated data sets - one that simulates
samples drawn from a Gaussian (normal) distribution and one that simulates
samples drawn from a Poisson distribution.

The advantage of simulated data over real data is that with simulated data, we
know the 'truth' and can therefore gauge the accuracy of estimates.


## Motivating example 1

Lets formally simulate the data illustrated above.  The underlying process
dictates that on average a one unit change in the predictor (`x`) will be associated with a five
unit change in response (`y`) and when the predictor has a value of 0, the
response will typically be 2.  Hence, the response (`y`) will be related to the predictor (`x`) via the following:

$$
y = 2 + 5x
$$

This is a deterministic model, it has no uncertainty. In order to simulate
actual data, we need to add some random noise.  We will assume that the
residuals are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of zero and
standard deviation of 4.  The predictor will comprise of 10 uniformly
distributed integer values between 1 and 10.  We will round the response to two
decimal places.

For repeatability, a seed will be employed on the random number generator.  
Note, the smaller the dataset, the less it is likely to represent the underlying
deterministic equation, so we should keep this in mind when we look at how
closely our estimated parameters approximate the 'true' values. Hence, the 
seed has been chosen to yield data that maintain a general trend that is
consistent with the defining parameters.

```{r sim, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
set.seed(234)
dat = data.frame(x=1:10) %>%
    mutate(y = round(2 + 5*x + rnorm(10, 0, 4), 2))
dat
ggplot(data=dat) + geom_point(aes(y=y, x=x))
```

We will use these data in two ways.  Firstly, to estimate the mean and variance
of the reponse (`y`) ignoring the predcitor (`x`) and secondly to estimate the
relationship between the reponse and predictor.

For the former, we know that the mean and variance of the response (`y`) can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{align}
\bar{y} =& \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}y_i\\
var(y) =& \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1}(y-\bar{y})^2\\
sd(y) =& \sqrt{var(y)}
\end{align}
$$

```{r stats1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
mean(dat$y)
var(dat$y)
sd(dat$y)
```


## Motivating example 2

The Poisson distribution is only parameterized by a single parameter
($\lambda$) which represents both the mean and variance.  Furthermore,
Poisson data can only be positive integers.  

Unlike simple trend between two Gaussian or uniform distributions,
modelling against a Poisson distribution alters the scale to
logarithms.  This needs to be taken into account when we simulate the
data.  The parameters that we used to simulate the underlying
processes need to either be on a logarithmic scale, or else converted
to a logarithmic scale prior to using them for generating the random
data. 

Moreover, for any model that involves a non-identity link function
(such as a logarithmic link function for Poisson models), 'slope' is
only constant on the scale of the link function.  When it is back
transformed onto the natural scale (scale of the data), it takes on a
different meaning and interpretation.

We will chose $\beta_0$ to represent a value of 2 when `x=0`.  As for
the 'effect' of the predictor on the response, lets say that for every
one unit increase in the predictor the response increaes by 20% (on
the natural scale).  Hence, on the log scale, the slope will be
$log(1.2)=$ `r log(1.2)`.

```{r sim2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, fig.width=3, fig.height=3}
set.seed(123)
beta = c(2, 1.20)
beta=log(beta)
n = 10
dat2 = data.frame(x=seq(1,10,len=n)) %>%
    mutate(y = rpois(n, lambda=exp(beta[1] + beta[2]*x)))
dat2
ggplot(data=dat2) + geom_point(aes(y=y, x=x)) 
```

# OLS

## Motivating example 1 (response only)

The Ordinary Least Squares (**OLS**) estimate of a **parameter** (e.g
the mean, $\mu$) is the value of this parameter that minimize the sum
of the square residuals (e.g. $(y_i-\mu)^2$).  That is, it minimize
the total difference between the observed values ($x_i$) and those
expected ($\mu$).  We __could__ calculate the residual sum of squares
(RSS) for a large number of combinations of potential parameter values
in order to find the 'optimum' parameter values (those that minimize
RSS).

```{r olsSim, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
mu = seq(15,40,len=1000)
rss = vector('numeric', length(mu))
for (i in 1:length(mu)) {
    rss[i] = sum((dat$y - mu[i])^2)
}
mu[which(rss==min(rss))]
ggplot(data=NULL) + geom_line(aes(y=rss, x=mu))
```

This minimum is very close to that calculated with the simple formula (as
applied with the `mean()` _function_).

### Matrix algebra

Now this is all fine and well, but what if we need to estimate multiple
parameters.  Lets see how we could estimate the mean via matrix algebra as a
stepping stone towards solving more complex problems.

We start by expressing the problem as a linear equation.

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \varepsilon_i
$$

Here, we are saying that our observed values, can be considered to be equal to
the mean of the values plus the individual deviations (residuals) of each of the
values from the mean.  Note, in the context of a linear model, this is just an
intercept only model.

Recall that the typical linear model might look like:


Now lets represent this in matrix form.
$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i
$$

Which is the same as:
$$
y_i = \beta_0\times 1 + \beta_1\times x_i + \varepsilon_i
$$

Returning to our intercept only model then:
$$
y_i = \beta_0\times 1 + \varepsilon_i
$$

And in matrix form, this would be:
$$
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\
y_2\\
y_3\\
...\\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}}_{Y} = 
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
1\\
1\\
1\\
...\\
1
\end{bmatrix}}_{\boldsymbol{X}}
\underbrace{\vphantom{\begin{bmatrix}
y_1\\
y_2\\
y_3\\
...\\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}}\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0
\end{bmatrix}}_{\boldsymbol{\beta}} + 
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_1\\
\varepsilon_2\\
\varepsilon_3\\
...\\
\varepsilon_n
\end{bmatrix}}_{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}
$$

- $Y$ represents a column vector of the observed data
- $\boldsymbol{X}$ represents what is called the _model matrix_.  In this case,
  that is just a single column matrix of 1s.  The ones indicate that there is an
  intercept.  In matrix algebra, matrices are multiplied, so a column of ones
  just ensures that the thing being multiplied does exist.
- $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ represents a vector of parameters to be estimated.  In
  this case, there is only one.
- $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ represents a column vector or residuals.  

This could all be summarised as:
$$
Y = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
$$

If we assume that the residuals ($\varepsilon$) are (independently and identically
distributed, _iid_) all independently drawn from the same normal distribution
with a mean of 0 and a constant variance, then there is a rather elegant
solution for solving for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$.

Recall that OLS estimates the value of the unknown parameters
($\boldsymbol{\beta}$) as the values that minimize the sum of the squared
residuals.  So lets start by expressing the above equation in terms of
$\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$.

$$
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = Y - \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}
$$

Via matrix algebra, we can calulate the sum of square residuals as
($\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}'\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$), where  $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}'$ is the transpose of $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$,
so $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}'\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is just:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_1 & \varepsilon_2 & \varepsilon_3 &...& \varepsilon_n
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_1\\
\varepsilon_2\\
\varepsilon_3\\
...\\
\varepsilon_n\\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_1\times\varepsilon_1 + \varepsilon_2\times\varepsilon_2 + \varepsilon_3\times\varepsilon_3 + ... + \varepsilon_n\times\varepsilon_n
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Based on all this, we could re-write $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^T\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ as:

$$
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^T\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = (Y - \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})^T(Y - \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta})
$$

If we then take the derivatives of the above with respect to
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, we will obtain the values of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ that
minimizes the sum of square residuals.
Altimately, we arrive at:

$$
\boldsymbol{\beta} = \underbrace{(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}}_{\frac{1}{n}} \underbrace{\boldsymbol{X}^T Y}_{\sum^n_{i=1}y_i}
$$

where $(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}$ is the inverse of
$(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X})$.  In matrix algebra, matrices are never
divided, only multiplied.  Therefore, to divide by
$(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X})$, it is necessary to multiply by the inverse of
$(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}$, in the same way that dividing by $n$ is
the same as multiplying by the inverse of $n$ which is of course $\frac{1}{n}$.

In the above equation, we can see how the matrix form translates directly into
the simple calculation of a mean.  $(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}$
equates to $\frac{1}{n}$ and $\boldsymbol{X}^T Y$ equates to $\sum^n_{i=1}y_i$.

So to estimate $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, all we have to do is perform the above
matrix multiplications.  Unfortunately, matrix inversion (e.g. calculating
$(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X})^{-1}$) is not always straight forward. _Note in
this case it is straight forward, because the matrix only has a single value_).

In order to be able to invert a matrix, the following must be satisfied:

- the matrix must be square (have the same number of rows as columns)
- be full rank, that is the number of independent columns (the _rank_) must be
  equal to the number of columns.

If these are the case, then we can obtain the inverse by decomposing the square matrix into two parts:

- the inverse (i.e. what we are after)
- an identity matrix (a bi-product that is typically thrown away)

In R, this can be achieved via the `solve()` (or `qr.solve()`) _functions_.

```{r mm, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
## Generate the single column matrix of 1s
X = cbind(rep(1,length(dat$y)))
## perform the matrix multiplications to solve for beta
## beta = (X'X)^-1 X'Y
beta = solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% dat$y
beta
```

This is the same as the empirical mean we calculated earlier.



## Linear regression via matrix algebra (example 1 data)

Recall the motivating example 1 data as:

```{r ex2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
dat
```

So the statistical model might be:

$$
\begin{align}
y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i\\
Y =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
\end{align}
$$

which can be represented in matrix form as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
`r dat$y[1]`\\
`r dat$y[2]`\\
`r dat$y[3]`\\
...\\
\end{bmatrix} = 
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
1&`r dat$x[1]`\\
1&`r dat$x[2]`\\
1&`r dat$x[3]`\\
...\\
\end{bmatrix}}_{\text{model matrix}}
\begin{bmatrix}
\beta_0\\
\beta_1
\end{bmatrix} + 
\begin{bmatrix}
\varepsilon_1\\
\varepsilon_2\\
\varepsilon_3\\
...\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

So, the response is represented by a vector and this is related to the _model matrix_ (a matrix representing the predictor(s)), a vector of parameters to
estimate ($\beta_0$: the intercept and $\beta_1$: the slope) and a vector of
residuals (random noise).

Recall that in order to estimate $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, we solve the following:
                                   
$$
\boldsymbol{\beta} = (\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X})^{-1} \boldsymbol{X}^T Y
$$


```{r mm1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
## Generate the model matrix
X = model.matrix(~x, data=dat)
## Solve for beta
beta = solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% dat$y
beta
```

This whole process, and more is conveniently wrapped into a simple function within R called `lm()`. 
```{r lm, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
lm(y~x, data=dat)
```

# Generalized linear models

Recall from the previous section that the simple linear model can be written as:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i\\
Y =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
\end{align}
$$

This could be re-written as:

$$
\begin{align}
y_i \sim{}& N(\mu_i, \sigma^2I)\\
\mu_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\\
\end{align}
$$

indicating that the response ($y$) is distributed as a Gaussian (normal) the
mean of which is determined by the linear relationship with $x$ and there is a
constant variance ($\sigma^2$) - all observations are independently and
identically distributed (_iid_) - independently drawn from a distribution with
the same variance.

The $I$ signifies an identity matrix (a square matrix whose diagonals are all one).

More generally, the above can be written in vector/matrix form as:
$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \sigma^2I)\\
\boldsymbol{\mu} =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

If we suspect that the residuals are not independent and identically distributed
(if for example they were Poisson distributed), then we could alter (generalise)
the above to:

$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \sigma^2\boldsymbol{W}^{-1})\\
\boldsymbol{\mu} =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{W}$ is a matrix of positive diagonals .

This allows us to generalise to other (exponential) families (such as Binomial,
Poisson, Negative Binomial, Gamma etc).  For example, if our response ($Y$) were
count data, we might consider a Poisson.

$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& Pois(\boldsymbol{\lambda})\\
\boldsymbol{\lambda} =& e^{\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\\
&\text{OR equivalently}\\
log(\boldsymbol{\lambda}) =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

The Poisson distribution ($P(x|\lambda) = e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x/x!$) is
parameterised by a single parameter ($\lambda$) that represents both the mean
and variance (as well as degrees of freedom).  Poisson data are bound at the
lower end by zero (negative values are not defined) - it is not possible to
count fewer than 0 things.  The Poisson family includes an exponential term,
therefore to map the expected values back onto the natural scale (scale of the
observed data), we use a **link** function (in the case of the Poission, this
link is a log link).  Hence the above can be generalized even further to:

$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& D(\boldsymbol{\eta}, ...)\\
g(\boldsymbol{\eta}) =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

where $D$ is the nominated family, $g$ is the link function and $...$ represents
any additional parameters required by the nominated distribution (such as
$\sigma^2\boldsymbol{W}^{-1}$ in the case of the Gaussian distribution).







# Maximum likelihood

Ordinary Least Squares provides an elegant solution for when the data
satisfy certain assumptions (normality, homogeneity, independence,
etc), yet for many other situations, it is not appropriate.

## Motivating example 1

As with OLS, lets start with motivating example 1 data

```{r ex1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
dat$y
```

A more general alternative to OLS is Maximum Likelihood (ML).

Likelihood is a measure of how probable (likely) a set of observations are at
following (or being drawn from) a specific distribution.  For example, we could
evaluate the likelihood that the observations could have come from a normal
(Gaussian) distribution with a specific mean and standard deviation.

Before we can understand likelihood, we must first remind ourselves of a couple of things about probability.

1. for any continuous distribution, the probability of obtaining a specific
   values (that is, that a specific value ($X$) is equal to a particular
   reference values ($x$)) is infinitely small ($Pr(X=x)=0$).  We can only
   directly estimate probabilities of obtaining values less than (or greater
   than) nominated reference points (quantiles).
2. it is possible to calculate the probability that a specific value ($X$) is between two reference points ($Q1$ and $Q2$).  This is
   just the probability of $X$ being less than Q1 minus the probability of $X$ being less than Q2 ($Pr(Q1 < X > Q2)$).

So although we cant estimate the probability that $Pr(X=x)$ directly from the distributions' function ($f(x)$), we can
approximate this by calculating the probability that $X$ is in the interval $[x,
x+\Delta]$:

$$
\frac{Pr(x < X \le x + \Delta)}{\Delta}
$$



The smaller $\Delta$ (so long as it is larger than 0), the more accurate the
estimate.  This becomes a simple calculus problem.  The derivative ($f'(x)$) of
the distributions' function is a **probability density function** (PDF).  The
PDF allows us to approximate the probability of obtaining a single value from a
distribution.

Provided the data are all iid (individually and identically distributed), and
thus from the same distribution, the probability (likelihood) that a set of
values ($X$) comes from a specific distribution (described by its parameters,
$\theta$) can be calculated as the product of their individual probabilities.

$$
L(X|\theta) = \prod^n_{i=1} f'(x_i|\theta)
$$

The products of probability densities can soon become very small and this can
lead to computation and rounding issues.  Hence it is more usual to work with
the logarithms of likelihood.  The log laws indicate that the log of a product
is the same as the sum of the individual logs ($log(A\times B) = log(A) +
log(B)$).

$$
LL(X|\theta) = \sum^n_{i=1} log(f'(x_i|\theta))
$$


The PDF of a Gaussian distribution is:

$$
P(x|\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 2\pi}} exp^{-\frac{1}{2}((x-\mu)/\sigma)^2}
$$

So in order to estimate the optimum values for the parameters ($\mu$ and $\sigma$), given our data ($x$), we would maximize the following:

Returning to our example, 

$$

=& -\frac{n}{2}ln(2\pi\sigma^2)-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\mu)^2
\end{align}
$$



**Note** optimization routines usually attempt to minimize rather than maximize.
Nevertheless, finding the maximum of a log-likelihood (what we are after) is the
same as finding the minimum of the negative log-likelihood.

For the examples and routines that follow, we will write our own code from first
principles as well as use existing built in R functions.  Although the code that
we write could be written to find maximums, the inbuilt functions typically
optimise on minimums.  As a result, to enable us to compare routines, we will
work with **minimizing negative log-likelihood**.

Do, lets now write a function for calculating the negative log-likelihood for
our data given a Gaussian distribution based on the formula above.


```{r LL, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
LL.gaus = function(theta, x) {
    m=theta[1]
    s=theta[2]
    ll = -(length(x)/2)*(log(2*pi*s^2)) + (-1/(2*s^2)) * sum((x-m)^2)
    ##OR
    ## ll = sum(dnorm(x, mean=m, sd=s, log=TRUE))
    return(-ll)
}
```


In a similar manner to the brute force approach we used to approximate OLS
earlier, lets use a brute force approach to explore the partial negative
log-likelihood profile for the mean and then approximate the mean (we will fix
the standard deviation at 1).  We refer to it as a partial profile, because it
is holding the other parameter constant.


```{r mle, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
mu = seq(15,40,len=1000)
theta=cbind(mu=mu,sigma=1)
B=apply(theta, 1, LL.gaus, dat$y)
theta[which(B==min(B)),]
ggplot(data=NULL) + geom_line(aes(y=B, x=theta[,'mu']))
```

Again, this estimation is very close to the 'true' value.

## Optimization {.tabset .tabset-faded}

Optimization algorithms are essentially search algorithms.  They are attempting
to find a single point in multidimensional space.  There are numerous types of
algorithms, each of which offers different advantages and disadvantages under
different circumstances.  For example, some assume that the underlying
likelihood is very smooth (changes very gradually) and gain efficiencies out of
being able to located minimums via differentiation.  Others are less efficient,
yet more accurate when the likelihood is not smooth or there are multiple local
minima.

Lets use an analogy to gain a better appreciation of the problem and solutions.
Imagine we had a big block of land and we wanted to install a well from which to
draw water from an underground aquifer.  Although there are no physical
restrictions on where the well can be positioned, we are keen on it being as
shallow as possible (perhaps because it is cheaper to drill a shallow well).

The depth from the land surface down to the aquifer is not constant over space
and we want to be able to put our well in the shallowest point.  Although we do
not know the true underground topography, we can drill narrow pilot holes and
accurately measure the depth down to the aquifer at any point in space.

To put this another way, although we do not know what the underground profile looks like
throughout the entire spatial domain (all possible latitide/longitude values),
we can estimate its value (depth) at any point (single latitude/longitude).  

<!-- The same is true of a (log)likelihood function - although we do not know what it -->
<!-- looks like, we can evaluate it for any combination of parameters. -->

To find the optimum location for our well, we need a search algorithm.  One that
is able to find the latitude/longitude associated with the minimum depth.  We
will showcase a few different options and try to describe the advantages and
disadvantages of each.  For example, in our well analogy, if the depth profile
was very smooth (undulated very slowly), we might be able to use approximations
to the curvature of the undulations to find where any minimums are.  On the
other hand, if the profile is not smooth (perhaps there are underground caves or
other abrupt underground geological features), such approximations may be very
inaccurate and more exhaustive searching (such as a grid of pilot holes) may be
required.

Just like with the underground aquifer, although a (negative) log-likelihood
function has an unknown profile in multidimensional space (one dimension for
each parameter to estimate), we can evaluate it for any combination of
parameters.

### Brute force

One conceptually simple way of searching for the minimum of a function is to
evaluate the function for a large number of parameter combinations (perhaps in a
grid).  For example, to drill a pilot hole every 100m in a grid.  If the grid is
fine enough, it will located the minimum (maximum) no matter what the functions
profile is. However, the finer the grid, the more effort is required - lower
efficiency.

The following code chunk evaluates and plots the negative log-likelihood for a
full ($100\times 100$) grid of parameter combinations.  Negative log-likelihood
is represented as a colour along the green to white spectrum.  The blue lines
represent major contours in the profile. The optimum parameters (those
associated with the minimum negative log-likelihood and thus maximum
log-likelihood) are indicated by the black solid point.

```{r bruteForce, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
mu = seq(15,40,len=100)
sigma=seq(10,20,len=100)
theta = expand.grid(mu=mu, sigma=sigma)
theta$LL=apply(theta, 1, LL.gaus, x=dat$y)
ggplot(data=theta,aes(y=mu, x=sigma, fill=LL)) +
    geom_tile(show.legend=FALSE) + geom_contour(aes(z=LL)) +
    geom_point(data=theta[which(theta$LL==min(theta$LL)),], aes(y=mu, x=sigma), fill='black') +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colors=terrain.colors(12)) +
    scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0))
theta[which(theta$LL==min(theta$LL)),]
```
The optimum solution yielded an estimated mean of 
`r theta[which(theta$LL==min(theta$LL)),]$mu` and sigma of 
`r theta[which(theta$LL==min(theta$LL)),]$sigma`.  These values are very similar
to the empirical calculations.

The brute force approach is a useful illustration, but it is practically limited
to just a one or two parameters and since the entire search space within the
domain needs to be evaluated.  This is essentially an exhaustive search
algorithm.  Furthermore, the accuracy is dependent on the resolution of the
grid.  The finer the grid, the more accurate, however it does require $n^p$
function evaluations (where $n$ is the number of grid increments per $p$
parameters.

Of course, we can always use a relatively course search grid and having
identified the 'optimum' parameter configuration within this grid, we could
apply a finer resolution grid over a narrower search domain.  This is analogous
to starting with a 100x100m drilling grid and then centring a 1x1m drilling grid
around the 'best' location.

### Simplex methods

A _simplex_ is a multidimensional space that has one more vertex than there are
parameter dimensions ($p+1$).  In this case, we are estimating two parameters,
therefore the simplex is a triangle (three vertices).  The most common form of
simplex optimisation is the **Nelder-Mead** algorithm.  As with most optimisation
algorithms, the Nelder-Mead algorithm is a search algorithm that aims to find a
point in multidimensional space as efficiently as possible.

Optimisation routines work on a wide variety of function (not just likelihood
functions).  To keep the terminology about what is being optimised general, the
function to be optimised is often referred to as a **loss** or **objective**
function. A loss function is any function that evaluates the performance (or
fit) of a set of events (i.e. data).  The further the loss is from zero, the
worse the fit (hence the desire to find the minimum).

The Nelder-Mead algorithm can be described as (keep in mind that it is a
minimisation rather than maximisation):

1. Start with some initial estimate values - e.g. a set of $p+1$ vertices for
   each parameter.
2. Identify the vertex with the highest (ie worst) loss (negative log-likelihood).
3. Reflect the simplex around the centroid of the other vertices 
    3a. If the reflected point is better (lower negative log-likelihood) than the second
		worst point, but not better than the best point, replace the worst point
		with the reflected point.
    3b. If instead, the reflected point is the best vertex, then expand this
	    point by doubling the reflection distance
		
        3b.1.  If this expanded point is better than the reflected point,
		       replace the worst point with the expanded point
        3b.2   Otherwise replace the worst point with the reflected point.
		
    3c. If instead neither 3a or 3b (the reflected point is not better than the
		second worst point, then contract the point by halving the reflection
		distance.
		
        3c.1.  If this contracted point is better than the worst point, replace the worst point with the contracted point
        3c.2.  Otherwise, shrink the entire simplex (contract all vertices towards the centroid)
		
4. Repeat Steps 2-3 until either the maximum number of iterations have occurred
   or the change in loss between two successive iterations is below a
   certain threshold.

Clearly, the more iterations are performed, the more accurate the estimates, and
yet the longer the search will take.

In the well analogy, the simplex represents three points of the search triangle.
Reflecting the triangle allows us to move away from the direction we know to be
deeper.  We expand the triangle in order to explore a new direction and contract
the triangle to narrow our search area.

Code for illustrating the process is listed as details below.  This code is a modification of the

Having seen this illustration, we could allow the Nelder-Mead simplex
optimization to iterate more thoroughly.  We will now instruct the routine to
iterate a maximum of 250 times.  Along with setting a maximum number of
iterations, most optimizations also have a stopping trigger based around the
extent of improvement between iterations.  This convergence tolerance defines a
threshold difference below which two successive iteration outcomes are
considered the same.  The lower the value, the more accuracy is demanded.

It is also a good idea to repeat the iterations again from multiple starting
configurations to ensure that any single optimization has not just settled n a
local minimum (maximum).

```{r simplexOptimNM, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
get.optim.NM(X.vert=as.matrix(simplex), params.init, objective.fn=LL.gaus, x=dat$y, iter.max=250, abs.tol=1e-08, control=list(fnscale=1,refl=1,expan=2,contr=-0.5,shrink=0.5))
get.optim.NM(X.vert=as.matrix(simplex - c(-0.5,0.2)), params.init, objective.fn=LL.gaus, x=dat$y, iter.max=250, abs.tol=1e-08, control=list(fnscale=1,refl=1,expan=2,contr=-0.5,shrink=0.5))
```

The two sets of estimated parameters (listed as `X.optim`) are very similar
(converged) and are very similar to those calculated empirically.

R has an inbuilt function (`optim()`) that is an interface to numerous
optimization algorithms, and the default algorithm is `Nelder-Mead`.  As with
other optimizations, `optim()` defaults to minimizing.  To force it to maximize
(if our likelihood function returned log-likelihood rather than negative
log-likelihood), we can indicate that the `fnscale` is -1.  Other important
optimization _control parameters_ include:

- `maxit` - the maximum number of iterations to perform (100 for Nelder-Mead).
- `abstol` - the absolute convergence tolerance.  The lower the tolerance, the
   smaller the change in optimized value (log-likelihood) required before
   convergence is reached.

```{r simplexOptim, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
optim(par=c(20,12), LL.gaus, x=dat$y, control=list(fnscale=1))
```

We can see that the negative log-likelihood calculation was performed 51 times
before convergence.  Whilst this is not the same as the number of iterations, it
does provide an estimate of the total computation load. 

If we compare this to the brute force approach (which required $100\times
100=10,000$ evaluations), the Nelder-Mead simplex approach is a substantial
improvement.

### Derivative methods

If the profile of a function is smooth enough, and the function itself is doubly
differentiable (can be differentiated into first and second order derivatives),
then we can make use of a group of algorithms based on a root-finding algorithm
devised by Isaac Newton.  In mathematical contexts, a root is the value of the
parameters ($x$) when the function equals zero ($f(x)=0$).

A simplified version of Newton's method, the **Newton-Raphson method** shows
that root ($x_{n+1}$) of a function ($f(x_n)$) can be approximated by
iteratively solving:

$$
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}
$$

where $x_n$ is the initial parameter estimate, $x_{n+1}$ is the improved
parameter estimate, $f(x_n)$ is the value of the function at $x_ n$ and
$f'(x_n)$ is the first order derivative (the slope) of the function at $x_n)$.

Before we use this approach to estimate maximum likelihood estimates, lets see
how it works with a polynomial function (e.g. $y=0.1x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + 30$).

In the following animation, we will use the Newton-Raphson method to estimate
the value of $x$ when $y=0$.  The animation will go through five iterations.
For each iteration, the red line represents the slope associated with the
initial estimate of $x$.  The point where this line intersects with the dashed
line ($y=0$) is the updated estimate for $x$.  We can see that by the fifth iteration, the estimated $x$ is has began to stabalise (converge) on a value of approximately $1.98$.

If we allow our implementation of the Newton-Raphson method to run from an initial guess of 3 until it converges:

```{r NMOptim, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
optim.NR(f, x0=3)
```

We see that it takes just `r optim.NR(f, x0=3)$iter` to converge.

In the above, we estimated the root (value of $x$ when $f(x)=0$) of a function.
If instead, we want to find the value of $x$ when the function is at its
minimum (e.g. optimisation), then we want to find the root of the first derivative ($f'(x)$) of the
function - that is, we want to find the value of $x$ where the slope of $f(x)$
is 0.

Again, in order to illustrate the principles of what we are trying to achieve,
we must digress from our actual example.  Rather than try to find the root of a
function, we will now try to find the root of the derivative of a function (so
as to find the minimum of a function).  So we are now shifting our focus away
from the profile of the function and onto the profile of the derivative of the
function (since the derivative of a function is a slope profile).

The left hand side of the following figure represents the profile of the function ($y = 0.001x^3 - 0.001x^2 - 0.3x + 5$).  
The right hand side represents the derivative ($0.001(3x^2) - 0.301(2x)$) of that function.

f1=D(body(f)[[2]], 'x')
x = seq(0,20,len=100)

Note that we are now looking for were the slope of the profile is equal to zero.
This makes no distinction between a peak (maximum) and a valley (minimum) as
both have a slope of zero.  Provided the (negative)log-likelihood profile is
monotonic (has either a single peak or valley), this should be OK.  It can
however be problematic if the profile has local minima and maxima.  To minimize
issues, it is best to select starting values (inital parameter values) that are
likely to be reasonably close to the optimum values.

Ok, great.  Now how do we use this approach to optimize for multiple parameters.

Recall that the Newton-Raphson method for optimisation estimates the root by
subtracting the ratio of the first order derivative of the (loss) function by
the second order derivative of the function.  
$$
x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f'(x_n)}{f''(x_n)}
$$

When there are multiple parameters
to estimate, then there are multiple **partial** gradients (slopes).  

Now that we are back to estimating the mean and variance of our example data, we
have two parameters to estimate.  Therefore we need:

- the partial derivative of the negative log-likelihood with respect to the mean
  parameter
- the partial derivative of the negative log-likelihood with respect to the
  sigma parameter
- the second order partial derivative with respect to mean of the first order
  derivative with respect to the mean
- the second order partial derivative with respect to sigma of the first order
  derivative with respect to the mean
- the second order partial derivative with respect to mean of the first order
  derivative with respect to the sigma
- the second order partial derivative with respect to sigma of the first order
  derivative with respect to the sigma

The second order partial derivatives form a square matrix called a **Hessian**
matrix.

When there are multiple parameters to estimate, the above formula becomes:
$$
\boldsymbol{x_{n+1}} = \boldsymbol{x_n} - \frac{\boldsymbol{g_n}}{\boldsymbol{H_n}}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{g_n}$ is a vector of partial gradients (first order
derivatives), $\boldsymbol{H_n}$ is a matrix of second order partial derivatives
and $\boldsymbol{x_n}$ and $\boldsymbol{x_{n+1}}$ are the previous and updated
parameter estimates respectively.

Recall that matrices cannot be divided.  Rather we must multiply by the matrix
inverse.  Hence the above equation becomes:

$$
\boldsymbol{x_{n+1}} = \boldsymbol{x_n} - (\boldsymbol{H_n})^{-1}\boldsymbol{g_n}
$$

Recall also to invert a matrix, it must be decomposed into an identity matrix
and the inverse.  In R, this can be achieved via either `solve()` or `qr.solve`.

On top of this, there is the need to calculate the first and second order
derivatives for a function for which there is no equation.  Hence, we need to
approximate the derivatives using **finite differences**.  That is,we can
estimate a derivative (gradient at a specific point on a profile), by
calculating the rise over run for a very small run ($\Delta$)

$$
\frac{df(x)}{dx} \approx \frac{(f(x) + \Delta x/2) - (f(x - \Delta x/2))}{\Delta x} 
$$

Now that all the pieces are in place, we can demonstrate this by iterating
through a number of Newton-Raphson cycles to estimate the mean and sigma of our
example 1 data.

Now lets allow the routine (`optim.NR()` defined in the concealed code above) to run to convergence.

```{r NManim4, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
optim.NR(params.init, fn=function(t) LL.gaus(t, x=dat$y))
```
Again, we see that these estimates (`final` in the output) are very similar to
the empirical calculations.  Furthermore, notice that convergence took only 5
iterations.

The inverse of the hessian matrix is the **variance-covariance** matrix.
Therefore, we can also generate estimates of the standard error of the
estimates:

$$
SE = \sqrt{diag(\boldsymbol{H})}
$$

```{r NManim5, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
H=optim.NR(params.init, fn=function(t) LL.gaus(t, x=dat$y))$hessian
sqrt(diag(solve(H)))
```

R has an inbuilt routine (`nlm()`) that performs the Newton-like method for optimisation.

```{r NManim6, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
nlm(LL.gaus, params.init, x=dat$y, hessian=TRUE, gradtol=1e-03)
H=nlm(LL.gaus, params.init, x=dat$y, hessian=TRUE, gradtol=1e-06*2)$hessian
sqrt(diag(solve(H)))
```

### Stochastic global optimisation

When the profile of a function is not smooth, derivative methods can struggle to
locate a minimum efficiently (if at all) and when the profile has multiple local
minima, both derivative and simplex methods can fail to converge on the "true"
parameter values.  Stochastic global methods add a random (_stochastic_)
component to increase the potential of finding the _global_ minimum when there
are multiple local minima.

If we return briefly to our well analogy, we might appreciate that there could
be multiple underground caves and depending on where our initial pilot hole is
drilled, the more efficient search algorithms might quickly hone in on a point
that is locally shallow yet not the shallowest location in the entire landscape.
Of course repeating the search from multiple random locations could help
alleviate this issue, yet it might still be difficult to discover the shallowest
point if this is associated with a very abrupt (rather than gradual) underground
geological feature.

The classic stochastic global method is called **simulated annealing** or the
**Metropolis algorithm** and it works as follows:

1. Start with some initial estimate values (one for each parameter) and
   calculate the loss function (e.i. the negative log-likelihood)
2. Pick a new set of parameter estimates _close_ to the previous - e.g. jump a
   small distance in multidimensional space - and again calculate the loss
   function.
3. If the value of the loss function is better (lower), accept the new parameters and return to Step 2.
4. If the value of the loss function is not better,
    - Calculate the difference ($\Delta L = L_{new} - L_{old}$) in loss between
	  the new and old parameter estimates
    - Pick a random number between 0 and 1
    - Accept the new parameter estimates if the random number is less than
	  $e^{-\Delta L/k}$ (where $k$ is a constant that regulates the acceptance
	  propensity), otherwise retain the previous parameter estimates.
    - Periodically (e.g. every 100 iterations), decrease $k$ so as to reduce the acceptance propensity.
    - Return to Step 2.
	
Rather than have a stopping rule based on convergence, simulated annealing
continues until the maximum number of iterations have been performed.  Along
with the capacity and encouragement to occasionally move 'uphill' (towards
higher loss values), a large number of iterations increases the chances that the
global minima will be discovered even in the presence of multiple minima.  The
iterations, keep track of the parameters associated with the 'best'
configuration.

There are variants of this algorithm that control the jump distance used to
select the next point.  By adaptively increasing and reducing the jump length
following acceptance and non-acceptance respectively, these variances are able
to further encourage wider exploration of the parameter space.

The following animation illustrates 4096 iterations (stepping up in $log_2$
increments).  The red point indicates the current 'best' parameter estimates.
Note that whilst the algorithm 'discovered' the 'best' solution after
approximately 100 iterations, it continued to explore the profile thoroughly.
If there had been other minima, it is likely to have discovered them as well.

```

Which is again very similar the empirical estimates.


## Linear regression via ML (example 2)

Recall the motivating example 2 data as:

```{r ex2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
```

and the statistical model as:

$$
\begin{align}
y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i\\
Y =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
\end{align}
$$

This could be re-written as:

$$
\begin{align}
y_i \sim{}& N(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\\
\end{align}
$$

OR more generally as:
$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \sigma^2)\\
\boldsymbol{\mu} =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

This allows us to generalise to other (exponential) families (such as Binomial,
Poisson, Negative Binomial, Gamma etc).  For example, if our response ($Y$) were
count data, we might consider a Poisson.

$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& Pois(\boldsymbol{\lambda})\\
\boldsymbol{\lambda} =& e^{\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\\
&\text{OR equivalently}\\
log(\boldsymbol{\lambda}) =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

The Poisson distribution ($P(x|\lambda) = e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x/x!$) is
parameterised by a single parameter ($\lambda$) that represents both the mean
and variance (as well as degrees of freedom).  Poisson data are bound at the
lower end by zero (negative values are not defined) - it is not possible to
count fewer than 0 things.  The Poisson family includes an exponential term,
therefore to map the expected values back onto the natural scale (scale of the
observed data), we use a **link** function (in the case of the Poission, this
link is a log link).  Hence the above can be generalized even further to:

$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& D(\boldsymbol{\mu}, ...)\\
g(\boldsymbol{\mu}) =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

where $D$ is the nominated family, $g$ is the link function and $...$ represents
any additional parameters required by the nominated distribution (such as
$\sigma^2$ in the case of the Gaussian distribution).

```{r LL1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
LL.gaus <- function(theta, y, X){
  k           <- ncol(X) # get the number of columns (independent vars)
  beta        <- theta[1:k] # vector of weights intialized with starting values
  mu          <- X %*% beta  # X is dimension (n x k) and beta is dimension (k x 1)
  sigma       <- theta[k+1] # should be pulled from the last of the starting values vector
  ll          <- sum(dnorm(y, mean = mu, sd = sigma, log = TRUE)) # sum of the PDF over each observation
  return(-ll)
}
```

X = model.matrix(~x, data=dat)
```

### Simplex methods (Nelder-Mead)

```

```




# Iterative re-weighted least squares

Recall from the previous section that the simple linear model can be written as:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \varepsilon_i\\
Y =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
\end{align}
$$

This could be re-written as:

$$
\begin{align}
y_i \sim{}& N(\mu_i, \sigma^2I)\\
\mu_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\\
\end{align}
$$

indicating that the response ($y$) is distributed as a Gaussian (normal) the
mean of which is determined by the linear relationship with $x$ and there is a
constant variance ($\sigma^2$) - all observations are independently and
identically distributed (_iid_) - independently drawn from a distribution with
the same variance.

The $I$ signifies an identity matrix (a square matrix whose diagonals are all one).

More generally, the above can be written in vector/matrix form as:
$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \sigma^2I)\\
\boldsymbol{\mu} =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

If we suspect that the residuals are not independent and identically distributed
(if for example they were Poisson distributed), then we could alter (generalise)
the above to:

$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \sigma^2\boldsymbol{W}^{-1})\\
\boldsymbol{\mu} =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{W}$ is a matrix of positive diagonals .

This allows us to generalise to other (exponential) families (such as Binomial,
Poisson, Negative Binomial, Gamma etc).  For example, if our response ($Y$) were
count data, we might consider a Poisson.

$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& Pois(\boldsymbol{\lambda})\\
\boldsymbol{\lambda} =& e^{\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}}\\
&\text{OR equivalently}\\
log(\boldsymbol{\lambda}) =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

The Poisson distribution ($P(x|\lambda) = e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x/x!$) is
parameterised by a single parameter ($\lambda$) that represents both the mean
and variance (as well as degrees of freedom).  Poisson data are bound at the
lower end by zero (negative values are not defined) - it is not possible to
count fewer than 0 things.  The Poisson family includes an exponential term,
therefore to map the expected values back onto the natural scale (scale of the
observed data), we use a **link** function (in the case of the Poission, this
link is a log link).  Hence the above can be generalized even further to:

$$
\begin{align}
Y \sim{}& D(\boldsymbol{\eta}, ...)\\
g(\boldsymbol{\eta}) =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
\end{align}
$$

where $D$ is the nominated family, $g$ is the link function and $...$ represents
any additional parameters required by the nominated distribution (such as
$\sigma^2\boldsymbol{W}^{-1}$ in the case of the Gaussian distribution).

In regular OLS regression we are trying to minimize the sum squares of residuals
($||Y - \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}||^2$).  This assumes that all residuals
are independent and identically distributed as each will be given equal weight
when summing.  However, we may wish to weight some observations (residuals) more
heavily than others.  For example, a reasonably common situation is for the
variance to be related to the mean (typically as the mean increases, so does the
variance).  We can partly compensate for this be weighting the residuals
inversely proportional to the mean ($w_i = 1/\mu_i$). 

Now, rather than trying to minimise the sum squares of residuals ($||Y - \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}||^2$), 
we now try to minimise the sum weighted residuals ($||Y -
\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}||^\boldsymbol{p}$), where $\boldsymbol{p}$ is a
vector of powers. 

This can also (and once we take into consideration the link function), be written
as the sum square of weighted residuals ($(g(\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}) -
Y)^T\boldsymbol{W}(g(\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}) - Y)$), where
$\boldsymbol{W}$ is the diagonal of a weights matrix.

Rather than calculate the residuals on the response scale (by backtransforming
the linear predictor $\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}$ to the same scale as the
response $Y$), the residuals are typically calculated on the link scale after
adjusting the response variable onto this scale.

The response is adjusted ($\boldsymbol{z}$) by adding the difference between observed and expected
(natural scale) re-mapped onto the link scale (by dividing by the derivative of
the expected value on the natural scale) to the expected value (on the link
scale).

$$
\boldsymbol{z} = \boldsymbol{\eta} + \frac{Y-g(\boldsymbol{\eta})}{g'(\boldsymbol{\eta})}
$$

where $\eta$ is the estimated linear predictor (predicted value of $y$ on the
scale of the link function), $g(\eta)$ is the inverse link of $\eta$ and
$g'(\eta)$ is the derivative of $g(\eta)$.

The weighted least squares formulation then becomes:
$$
\boldsymbol{\beta} = (\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{X}^{-1})\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{z}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{W}$ is the diagonal of a weights matrix:

$$
\boldsymbol{W} = diag\left(\frac{g'(\boldsymbol{\eta})^2}{var(g(\boldsymbol{\eta}))}\right)
$$

Unfortunately, there is no closed form solution for the above and thus it is
usually solved iteratively, and is thus called **iterative re-weighted least
squares**.  A very simplistic implementation of an iterative re-weighted least
squares could be:

1. Start with some initial values for the parameters ($\beta$} - typically 0 for
   each parameter (on the link scale and thus, 1 on the response scale)
2. Calculate the predicted value of the response given the current estimates of
   $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ as well as the adjusted response ($\boldsymbol{z}$) and
   weights ($\boldsymbol{W}$).
3. Update the estimated parameter values
4. Repeat septs 2-3 until either the maximum number of iterations has occurred
   or a measure of the difference between successive iterations is below a set tolerance.

        W = as.vector(g.^2 / family()$variance(g))  # calculate (update) the weights
        oldpar = newpar
        newpar = solve(crossprod(X,W*X), crossprod(X,W*z), tol=2*.Machine$double.eps)
        iter = iter + 1
        not.max.iter <- (iter < iter.max)*1
        not.converged=(max(abs((1-newpar/oldpar)))>abs.tol)*1
    }
    list(B.optim=newpar, Iter=iter-1)
}
```

Note, when the family is Gaussian, the above is simplified to the OLS form:

$$
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{\beta} =& 0\\
\boldsymbol{\eta} =& \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} = 0\\
\boldsymbol{z} =& \boldsymbol{\eta} +
\frac{Y-g(\boldsymbol{\eta})}{g'(\boldsymbol{\eta})} = 0 + \frac{Y-0}{1} = Y\\
\boldsymbol{W} =&
diag\left(\frac{g'(\boldsymbol{\eta})^2}{var(g(\boldsymbol{\eta}))}\right) =
diag(1^2/1) = 1\\
\boldsymbol{\beta} =&
(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{X}^{-1})\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{z}
= (\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X}^{-1})\boldsymbol{X}^TY
\end{align}
$$


Lets try it out, starting with an intercept only model - which is just estimating the mean response value (according to a Poisson distribution).

```{r optim.IRLS.fit1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
optim.IRLS(cbind(rep(1,length(dat$y))), dat$y, family=gaussian)
```

This estimate is (not surprisingly) identical to the OLS estimate.

So what if we modified the response such that it was some positive integers and
we nominate a Poisson distribution..

```{r optim.IRLS.fit2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
optim.IRLS(cbind(rep(1,length(dat2$y))), dat2$y, family=poisson)
exp(optim.IRLS(cbind(rep(1,length(dat2$y))), dat2$y, family=poisson)$B.optim)
```

After `r optim.IRLS(cbind(rep(1,length(dat2$y))), dat2$y, family=poisson)$Iter` iterations, 
the algorithm converged on an estimate of 
`r optim.IRLS(cbind(rep(1,length(dat2$y))), dat2$y, family=poisson)$B.optim`,
which on the natural scale would be 
`r exp(optim.IRLS(cbind(rep(1,length(dat2$y))), dat2$y, family=poisson)$B.optim)`.

In R, there is an inbuilt function called `glm()` that fits generalized linear
models by default via iterative re-weighted least squares.

```{r optim.IRLS.fit3, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
glm(y ~ 1, data=dat2, family=poisson)
```

And now we will explore the full model:

```{r optim.IRLS.fit4, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
X = model.matrix(~x, dat2)
irls = optim.IRLS(X, dat2$y, family=poisson)
irls
exp(irls$B.optim)
```

Both estimates are very close to the parameters on which the simulated
data were generated, and identical to those returned from the inbuilt
`glm()` __function__.

```{r optim.IRLS.fit5, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
glm(y ~ x, data=dat2, family=poisson)
```
